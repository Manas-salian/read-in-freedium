## Read-in-Freedium

### Overview :
This Chrome extension allows users to easily redirect Medium articles to Freedium providing free access to premium Medium content.
### Inspiration :
I had been using freedium for quite some time but one day i decided to look if there was a browser extension to quickly open a medium article in freedium and thus i found [this](https://github.com/wywywywy/freedium-browser-extension) project by @wywywywy. My project is not as feature rich but it was a great learning experience.
